<h1 style=text-align:center;>Reading reflection</h1>
<p style="font-size:30px;text-indent: 2em;">Reading Susan Sontag’s “In Plato’s Cave” really made me think differently about photography and even about how I look at the world. Sontag argues that photography isn’t just a neutral way to record things, it actually shapes how we remember, how we learn, and how we connect to events and people.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px; text-indent: 2em;">This article also made me reflect on the role of photography in my personal life and the world around me. From my personal experience, photography has always been a way to capture memories and preserve moments that I do not want to forget. When I take pictures with my phone, I feel like I am collecting pieces of my own life, whether it is a casual walk in the city, a meal with friends, or even a random interesting scene on the street. At the same time, I notice that sometimes I am more focused on taking a photo than actually living in the moment.This habit risks making me perceive reality through the camera’s lens rather than my own eyes.Photography can freeze moments beautifully, but it can also make me miss the subtleties of experiencing them in real time. I have even caught myself scrolling through my camera roll later and realizing that I barely remembered the actual feelings of those moments, only the images I had taken. </p>
<p style="font-size:30px;text-indent:2em">Reflecting on this, I’ve started to think of photography as both powerful and risky. It allows us to preserve, share, and communicate across time and space, yet it also tempts us to substitute images for authentic experience. I remember hearing a sentence that still leaves a deep impression on me to this day: Truly happy moments are too late to be recorded. Therefore, we should feel the present with our hearts even more. Photography is to help us preserve the beauty as memories, but we cannot rely solely on photos to feel the beauty.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;text-indent:2em">This semester, as I work through ten different projects using various tools and mediums, I want to be intentional about the act of selection. I don’t just want to use photos to represent the world, but also to question it. Sontag argues that photographs can “level the meaning of all events,” reducing everything to a consumable image. In response, I hope to create work that resists this flattening, using visual language to highlight nuance, contradiction, and emotion. I also want to experiment with combining images and text to convey layers of meaning that a single photograph alone cannot capture. Hopefully, by doing this, my work won’t just reflect my perspective, I have even caught myself scrolling through my camera roll later and realizing that I barely remembered the actual feelings of those moments, only the images I had taken.</p>
