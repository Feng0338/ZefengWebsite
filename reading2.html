<h1 style="text-align: center;">Reading reflection for "AI slop"</h1>

<p style="font-size:30px ;text-indent: 2em;">In her article, “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster,” Nesrine Malik discusses a phenomenon she calls “AI slop” and how it distorts reality in the visual and informational realms, leaving us passive and numb.She warned that AI-generated visual content, ranging from fantasy landscapes and cartoon characters to political images and videos, is flooding social media and chat apps, creating "visual stimulation" in a cheap way and confusing our judgment of the real world. In the long run, we may become numb and unable to respond to what is truly important.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;text-indent: 2em;">I found her point compelling because I've personally experienced the saturation of AI-generated content on social media. For example, posts that appear authentic but later turn out to be AI-generated have made me less and less confident in the information I read online.Instead of really helping people acquire knowledge better, AI has flooded the digital space with redundant and superficial content, squeezing out real voices and undermining people's confidence in reliable sources of information.</p>
<p style="font-size: 30px;text-indent: 2em;">In my own experience, when I watch videos or see certain images online, I'm shocked at first glance and never consider that they're fake, synthesized by AI. However, we all know that some people have keen judgment and can easily detect the authenticity of videos and images. It's only when I read the comments that I realize they're fake. This can lead people to misunderstand and even try some of the behaviors depicted in the videos, which can have extremely serious consequences. Therefore, the prevalence of AI-generated content online doesn't necessarily mean AI is bad.As a high-tech product of the new era, AI has indeed brought many conveniences to our lives. For example, it is very convenient to find information. If you have questions, you can ask them anytime and anywhere and they can be solved quickly. This is undeniable. However, we must also admit that there are indeed disadvantages. Many people use AI to synthesize content that lacks authenticity. It is difficult for children with immature minds to distinguish whether it is true or false, and the content in the video is likely to mislead them.</p>
<p style="font-size: 30px;text-indent: 2em;">Reflecting on this, I believe we must learn to view information critically and support institutions that prioritize truth and accuracy. For students like me, this means developing media literacy—learning to verify information, consider sources, and be wary of content that might be AI-generated. At the same time, I believe AI isn't inherently harmful; its value depends on how humans use it. Used wisely, AI can help us in education, creativity, and efficiency. But Malik is right to warn: without boundaries, AI garbage will drown out meaningful voices and make the truth seem “dispensable.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 30px;text-indent: 2em;">In short, Malik's article serves as both a warning and a call to action. It made me realize how fragile the digital world I participate in every day is, and how critical thinking is more important than ever.The disastrous nature of “AI garbage” lies not in the intelligence of machines, but in the weaknesses of human nature—our greed for convenience, our numbness to chaos, and our tendency to shirk responsibility.AI has great potential, but we need to keep a clear mind at all times and not rely solely on AI to do things. We need to have our own ideas and use our own thinking to judge things.</p>
